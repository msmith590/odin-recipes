    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Here is a phenomenal recipe for French Onion Soup that I have been making
      for years! Everyone I have made this for has been impressed by how simple
      it is to put together. It also presents well too! Enjoy!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons of butter</li>
      <li>2 large red onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 large sweet onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>1 can of chicken broth (48 ounces)</li>
      <li>1 can of beef broth (14 ounces)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of red wine</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 sprigs of fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 sprig of fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>4 thick slices of French bread</li>
      <li>8 slices of Gruyère cheese, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of shredded Asiago cheese, at room temperature</li>
      <li>4 pinches of paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in red onions,
        sweet onions, and salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are
        caramelized and almost syrupy, about 35 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in chicken broth, beef broth, red wine, and Worcestershire sauce.
        Bundle parsley, thyme, and bay leaf with kitchen twine; add to the pot.
        Simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove
        and discard herb bundle. Reduce heat to low; stir in vinegar and season
        with salt and pepper. Cover soup and keep warm over low heat while you
        prepare the toast.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
        oven's broiler. Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet and broil,
        turning once, until well toasted on both sides, about 3 minutes. Remove
        from heat; do not turn off the broiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange 4 large oven-safe bowls or crocks on a rimmed baking sheet. Fill
        each bowl 2/3 full with hot soup. Top each bowl with 1 slice of toasted
        bread, 2 slices Gruyère cheese, and 1/4 of the Asiago cheese. Sprinkle a
        little bit of paprika over the top of each one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook under the hot broiler until bubbly and golden brown, about 5
        minutes. Cheese will cascade over the sides of the crock and form a
        beautifully melted crusty seal as it melts.
      </li>
      <li>Serve!</li>
